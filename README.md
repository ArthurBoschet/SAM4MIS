# Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Medical Image Segmentation.

*  With the recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this prompt-driven paradigm has entered and revolutionized image segmentation. 
*  We aim to set up a daily-update literature reviews of SAM in medical image segmentation.
		

## Literature reviews of applying segment anything model for medical image segmentation.
